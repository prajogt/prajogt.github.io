        I love spending time outdoors, especially fishing - it's my happy place. There's just something about being in nature and casting a line that I find so relaxing.

        When I'm not enjoying nature by or on the water, I'm into sim racing. Sort of the counter to the serenity of fishing, it provides controlled / contained chaos,
        the thrill with none of the risk. 

        But I'm not all play - I'm also a bit of a problem solver. I enjoy the challenge of using programming and other technology to solve problems that I face.

        So, whether you're into fishing, gaming, or tech stuff, let's connect! 🎣🏎️💻
